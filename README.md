This project involves creating a classic Rock–Paper–Scissors game using Python, where a user plays against the computer. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the use of basic programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and random number generation.
The game starts by asking the user to choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The computer simultaneously generates its move using Python’s built-in random module. The program then compares both choices based on the game’s rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
Using conditional logic, the program determines whether the user wins, loses, or ties with the computer. The result is displayed after every round. The game can be played repeatedly using a loop until the user decides to exit.
This project highlights core Python skills such as input handling, decision-making, randomization, and user-interaction. It is ideal for beginners and demonstrates how simple logic can be used to build interactive console-based games.
